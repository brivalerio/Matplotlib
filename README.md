*Pyber Challenge*<br/>
<br/>
For this exercise, we've become the Chief Data Strategist for a new ride sharing company, Pyber. In this role, we're to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.<br/>
<br/>
**Observable Trends**<br/>
-Urban areas account for the most rides, by far, compared to suburban and rural areas.<br/>
-Average fares in rural areas trend towards a higher cost.  Possibly due to a lower amount of drivers and geographic restrictions (example: unpaved roads).<br/>
-Urban areas account for almost two thirds (63%) of total fares, and over two thirds (68%) of the total rides.<br/>
-81% of the companys drivers are based in urban areas.<br/>
-The average fare cost in urban cities is lower compared to the other city types.  This might be due to the distance traveled per ride, however not having the actual data to back this statement, it's only an assumption.<br/>
<br/>
These observed trends are based on graphic data that includes:<br/>
A Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:<br/>
-% of Total Fares by City Type<br/>
-% of Total Rides by City Type<br/>
-% of Total Drivers by City Type<br/>
<br/>
Along with the following pie charts:<br/>
-Average Fare ($) Per City<br/>
-Total Number of Rides Per City<br/>
-Total Number of Drivers Per City<br/>
-City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)<br/>
